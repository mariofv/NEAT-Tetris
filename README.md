This project contains a clone of the well-known videogame [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) and an AI agent that learns how to play it using the algorithm [NEAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies). The project was developed during my Final Thesis in the Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science of the [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/ca) - [Facultat d'informàtica de Barcelona](https://www.fib.upc.edu/).
